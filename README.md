## Getting Started

I included this repository for my growing collection of links and resources that I've accumulated. My bookmarks folder is overflowing with links and articles, so I figured I'd give it some structure and slap it on GitHub.

## Algorithms

## Job Search

#### Resources for finding a job
* [Angel List](http://www.angel.co)
  * Usually startups, send a note to companies. Also, always send a note on the "Browse Jobs" section. It will include a name of a person you can send a note to. If you apply though a specific job posting, the name of the person disappears in the note you can send. Why this is, I have no idea.
* Hacker News
    * Hacker News usually has a monthly "Who is Hiring?" megathread. To find that, googling the current month + "who is hiring" is probably the best option (unless there is some direct link I don't know about to the current month's postings). Also,
    [HN Jobs](https://news.ycombinator.com/jobs)
* [Hired](www.hired.com)
  * Coding challenge,(2 mandatory + 1 extra if you get that far in the time limit) unless you've proven you have work experience and the credentials to bypass the challenge. Each application comes up with a "Talent Advocate" that oversees your application
* [Sourceful](https://github.com/sourceful/jobs)
* [TripleByte](https://triplebyte.com/)
    * Coding challenge as part of the applicaton.
