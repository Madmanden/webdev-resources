# developer_resources
personal repository of links and resources I study and algorithms I study. I've accumulated a long list of bookmarks and having this repository makes it easier for me to see everything on one page.

## Getting Started (new developers)
I included this section because I do have a lot of friends that are trying to become developers from different backgrounds. These are primarily the resources, in order, that I went through in order to become more familiar with JavaScript. This includes material that I used to get in to Hack Reactor as well as what I think could be really useful for getting up to speed.

## Algorithms

## Job Search

#### Resources for finding a job
1. [Angel List](http://www.angel.co)
  * Usually startups, send a note to companies. Also, always send a note on the "Browse Jobs" section. It will include a name of a person you can send a note to. If you apply though a specific job posting, the name of the person disappears in the note you can send. Why this is, I have no idea.
1. Hacker News

      * Hacker News usually has a monthly "Who is Hiring?" megathread. To find that, googling the current month + "who is hiring" is probably the best option (unless there is some direct link I don't know about to the current month's postings). Also,

1. [Hired](www.hired.com)
  * Coding challenge,(2 mandatory + 1 extra if you get that far in the time limit) unless you've proven you have work experience and the credentials to bypass the challenge. Each application comes up with a "Talent Advocate" that oversees your application
1. [TripleByte](https://triplebyte.com/)
    * Coding challenge as part of the applicaton.
